##The goal to achieve/ Purpose
The project was built having in mind the pre-stablished requirements that is to create a console application in healthcare, education, economics or any other topic, with CRUD(Create Read Update and Delete) as minimal functionality of application.

In order to give the user the ability to decide, which action they want to examine and how many times, everything is organized into menus.

###User experience target
 The User has to communicate with the program via console (data input and output);  manage and store element data in an XML file.

###How does this project help?
The project serves as medium to store data in an easy and quick way. As a management tool, it facilitates the CRUD process, and ensures automation of some tasks related to a school system. A more precise description can be found in the subsequent lines throughout the document.
